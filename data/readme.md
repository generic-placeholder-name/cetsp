# Dataset

This repository contains the **CMU/Mennell dataset** for the CETSP.

- The dataset located at `./cmu` is the publicly available version from the [UMD repository](https://drum.lib.umd.edu/items/a532bfe4-9fe2-40ab-b562-f5851ddd87d9).
- Note: This dataset is **not identical** to the one used o benchmark previous papers. I suspect that the dataset was changed some time ago. 

To process the dataset into a comparable format, use the provided Python scripts in this directory.

The `benchmark` directory, from Lei and Hao (2024), represents SOTA solutions.
